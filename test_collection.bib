abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Despite growing interest in Open Access (OA) to scholarly literature, there is an unmet need for large-scale, up-to-date, and reproducible studies assessing the prevalence and characteristics of OA. We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28{\%} of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45{\%}). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47{\%} of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18{\%} more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Using a panel of cita-tions to economics and business journals, we show that the enormous effects found in previous studies were an artifact of their failure to control for article quality, disappearing once fixed effects are added as controls. The absence of aggregate effects masks heterogeneity across platforms: JSTOR has a uniquely large effect, boosting citations around 10{\%}. We examine other sources of heterogeneity, including whether JSTOR dispro-portionately increases cites from developing countries or to ''long-tail'' articles. Our theoretical analysis informs the econometric specification and allows citation increases to be translated into welfare terms.},

abstract = {Does free access to journal articles result in greater diffusion of scientific knowledge? Using a randomized controlled trial of open access publishing, involving 36 participating journals in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, we report on the effects of free access on article downloads and citations. Articles placed in the open access condition (n=712) received significantly more downloads and reached a broader audience within the first year, yet were cited no more frequently, nor earlier, than subscription-access control articles (n=2533) within 3 yr. These results may be explained by social stratification, a process that concentrates scientific authors at a small number of elite research universities with excellent access to the scientific literature. The real beneficiaries of open access publishing may not be the research community but communities of practice that consume, but rarely contribute to, the corpus of literature.—Davis, P. M.

abstract = {Many studies show that open access (OA) articles—articles from scholarly journals made freely available to readers without requiring subscription fees—are downloaded, and presumably read, more often than closed access/subscription-only articles. Assertions that OA articles are also cited more often generate more controversy. Confounding factors (authors may self-select only the best articles to make OA; absence of an appropriate control group of non-OA articles with which to compare citation figures; conflation of pre-publication vs. published/publisher versions of articles, etc.) make demonstrating a real citation difference difficult. This study addresses those factors and shows that an open access citation advantage as high as 19{\%} exists, even when articles are embargoed during some or all of their prime citation years. Not surprisingly, better (defined as above median) articles gain more when made OA.},

partner, is thought to be a core component of group cohesion and
coordination. However, the mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon
are poorly understood. Understanding why behaviour is mimicked in some
contexts but not in others is an important step in developing hypotheses
about how and why some behaviours spread between social partners. Here
we examine mimicry of routine vigilance during grazing episodes in a
population of free-ranging bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, rams. Results
indicate that vigilance bouts are more likely to be mimicked when
neighbouring rams are in closer proximity, more familiar with one
another and posturally aligned. Additionally, older rams are more likely
than young rams to mimic the vigilance bouts of others, and mimicry
occurs more often when the initiating ram is lower ranking than the
mimicking ram. We interpret these findings within the framework of
biases in attentiveness to particular individuals as a possible
mechanism leading to the occurrence of behavioural mimicry. (C) 2017 The

abstract = {Some ecologists suggest that trophy hunting (e.g., harvesting males with
a desirable trait above a certain size) can lead to rapid phenotypic
change, which has led to an ongoing discussion about evolutionary
consequences of trophy hunting. Claims of rapid evolution come from the
statistical analyses of data, with no examination of whether these
results are theoretically plausible. We constructed simple quantitative
genetic models to explore how a range of hunting scenarios affects the
evolution of a trophy such as horn length. We show that trophy hunting
does lead to trophy evolution defined as change in the mean breeding
value of the trait. However, the fastest rates of phenotypic change
attributable to trophy hunting via evolution that are theoretically
possible under standard assumptions of quantitative genetics are 1-2
orders of magnitude slower than the fastest rates of phenotypic change
reported from statistical analyses. Our work suggests a re-evaluation of
the likely evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting would be
appropriate when setting policy. Our work does not consider the ethical
or ecological consequences of trophy hunting. (c) 2017 The Wildlife

abstract = {Cohort effects, when a common environment affects long-term performance, can have a major impact on population dynamics. Very few studies of wild animals have obtained the necessary data to study the mechanisms leading to cohort effects. We exploited 42 years of individual-based data on bighorn sheep to test for causal links between birth density, body mass, age at first reproduction (AFR), longevity and lifetime reproductive success (LRS) using path analysis. Specifically, we investigated whether the effect of early-life environment on lifetime fitness was the result of indirect effects through body mass or direct effects of early-life environment on fitness. Additionally, we evaluated whether the effects of early-life environment were dependant on the environment experienced during adulthood. Contrary to expectation, the effect on LRS mediated through body mass was weak compared to the effects found via a delay in AFR, reduced longevity and the direct effect of birth density. Birth density also had an important indirect effect on LRS through reduced longevity, but only when adult density was high. Our results show that the potential long-term consequences of a harsh early-life environment on fitness are likely to be underestimated if investigations are limited to body mass instead of fitness at several life stages, or if the interactions between past and present environment are ignored.},

The resulting isolation is assumed to increase population extinction rates, in part because of the loss of genetic diversity. However, there are few cases where loss of genetic diversity has been linked directly to roads or other barriers. We analysed the effects of such barriers on connectivity and genetic diversity of 27 populations of Ovis canadensis nelsoni (desert bighorn sheep). We used partial Mantel tests, multiple linear regression and coalescent simulations to infer changes in gene flow and diversity of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers. Our findings link a rapid reduction in genetic diversity (up to 15{\%}) to as few as 40 years of anthropogenic isolation. Interstate highways, canals and developed areas, where present, have apparently eliminated gene flow. These results suggest that anthropogenic barriers constitute a severe threat to the persistence of naturally fragmented populations.},
